# The Power of Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Probability
3. Hypothesis testing 
4. Sampling and estimations


### Hypothesis testing

#### Steps for conducting a hypothesis test:
1. State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
2. Choose a significance level.
3. Find the p-value.
4. Reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.


When you decide to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, there are four possible outcomes–two represent correct choices, and two represent errors. You can: 

1. Reject the null hypothesis when it’s actually true (Type I error)
2. Reject the null hypothesis when it’s actually false (Correct)
3. Fail to reject the null hypothesis when it’s actually true (Correct) 
4. Fail to reject the null hypothesis when it’s actually false (Type II error)

Descriptive Statistics: Understand measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation). Be familiar with concepts such as range, quartiles, and percentiles.

Probability: Learn the basics of probability theory, including probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson), conditional probability, and Bayes' theorem. Understand how to calculate probabilities and work with events.

Hypothesis Testing: Comprehend the fundamentals of hypothesis testing, including null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, significance levels, and type I and type II errors. Familiarize yourself with common statistical tests, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.

Sampling and Estimation: Learn about sampling techniques and their implications. Understand concepts related to sampling error, confidence intervals, and margin of error. Be able to interpret confidence intervals and point estimates.

Regression Analysis: Gain knowledge of simple linear regression and multiple regression. Understand concepts like correlation, coefficient of determination (R-squared), interpretation of regression coefficients, and hypothesis testing in regression.

Experimental Design: Familiarize yourself with principles of experimental design, including control groups, randomization, and sample size determination. Understand concepts like confounding variables and the distinction between observational and experimental studies.

Data Visualization: Develop skills in visualizing data effectively using graphs, charts, and other visualization techniques. Be familiar with common visualization tools such as Excel, Tableau, or Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Learn techniques for exploring and cleaning datasets, including handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Understand the importance of data quality and its impact on statistical analysis.

Time Series Analysis: If relevant to the role, familiarize yourself with time series concepts, including trend analysis, seasonality, autocorrelation, and forecasting techniques like moving averages and exponential smoothing.

Statistical Software: Gain proficiency in statistical software packages commonly used in data analysis, such as R or Python (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy), as well as statistical tools like SPSS or SAS.
